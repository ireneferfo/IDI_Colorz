    <li><b>Painted in</b>: place where the artist created the piece, when available;</li>
    <li><b>Keyword</b>: word desctibing the piece, useful for filtering by content;</li>
    <li><b>Color</b>: a color picker appears where the user can select whichever color they like, and the pictures will be filtered by whether or not that color is in the 5 most predominant in the piece. </li>
</ul>
